# Overall Metholodogy.

Each CVEs has following attribute (columns).

| Field              | Description                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------- |
| CVE ID             | Unique ID for a security flaw.                            |
| URL                | Link to more vulnerability details.                       |
| OS                 | Affected operating systems and versions.                  |
| Description        | Summary of the security problem.                          |
| Causes             | High level programming error such as lack of language support. |
| Symptoms           | Low level security primitive such as out-of-bounds access. |
| Solved by CHERI?   | Can CHERI hardware prevent this flaw?                     |
| Solved by Rust?    | Can Rust language prevent this flaw?                      |
| Note               | Additional comments                                       |

One can find different summary of the entire datasets under a few different sheets

- summary by cause
- summary by symptom
- CHERI vs RUST

# Query the dataset

## Google Sheets
1. Go to`CVEs` tab. 
2. Click on top left calculator icon and select `create custom filter`
3. Click on filter icon on desire column (attribute) to set filter.

Example: 
One can view all CVEs that are labeled with cause of polymorphism by only selecting `Language -  Polymorphism` category. 




## Python script


Alternatively, we also provide a Python script that uses **pandas** to filter columns and return a breakdown of manifestations and causes. This script can be used to quickly navigate the dataset.

**Repo:** https://github.com/mars-research/cheri-impact-artifact

**Dependencies:** Python, pandas (Python library)

**Instructions:**  
Clone the repository and navigate into it:

```bash
cd <repo-name>
```

Install pandas if necessary:  
<https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html>

Then run:  
```bash
python3 filter.py
```

Once executed, you will see the following menu:

```
Select dataset:
1. All CVEs Dataset
2. Rust vs CHERI Dataset
3. Quit
```

Option 1 corresponds to the **CVEs** dataset:  
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13GzB_10g1z9h21mgp-T2l2h9haLcvQ9AhgLa691QuHI/edit?gid=1583578375#gid=1583578375>  

Option 2 corresponds to the **CHERI vs Rust CVEs** dataset:  
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13GzB_10g1z9h21mgp-T2l2h9haLcvQ9AhgLa691QuHI/edit?gid=1502739052#gid=1502739052>  

After choosing a dataset, you will be prompted to select a column to filter on, for example:

```
Available columns:
1. CVE ID
2. URL
3. OS
4. Description
5. Causes
6. Symptoms
7. Solved by CHERI?
8. Solved by Rust?
9. Notes
```

Next, you will be shown the unique values within that column. In this example, we select option **3 (OS):**

```
Values in 'OS':
1. Linux
2. FreeBSD
```

Finally, choosing the value to filter on such as **1 (Linux)** produces a breakdown of manifestations and causes:

```
Symptoms and counts:
Use after free                                Total=96   | Solved by CHERI?: Yes=96, No=0
...

Causes and counts:
Language - Lifetime violation                 Total=68   | Solved by CHERI?: Yes=38, No=30
...
```

These results correspond to data shown in the tables, in this example the Linux entries from **Table 2**.

Note: “Language – Null byte termination” appears in the tables as “Language – Sentinel arrays,” and manifestations are referred to as “Symptoms” in the tables.

# Recreating Tables 1–5

To recreate **Tables 1 and 2**, query each value in the **“OS”** column of the first dataset:

Select dataset:  
> 1. CVEs Dataset  

Available columns:  
> 3. OS  

Values in 'OS':  
> 1. Linux  
> 2. FreeBSD  

Each query returns its respective Linux or FreeBSD portion of the table.  

---

To recreate **Table 3**, query each value in the **“Causes”** column of the same dataset:

Select dataset:  
> 1. CVEs Dataset  

Available columns:  
> 5. Causes  

Values in 'Causes':  
> 1. Language -  Polymorphism  
> 2. Language - Lifetime violation  
> 3. Semantic - Logic error  
> 4. Language - Improper memory initialization  
> 5. Protocol - Missing Protocol Steps  
> 6. Race condition - Improper usage of synchronization primitives  
> 7. Semantic - Spec error  
> 8. Semantic - Improper input validation  
> 9. Race condition - TOUTOC  
> 10. Protocol - Sleeping in atomic context  
> 11. Language - Integer overflow  
> 12. Semantic - Missing return value check  
> 13. Semantic - Loop termination  
> 14. Language - Container_of  
> 15. Semantic - Security and permissions  
> 16. Language - Null byte termination  

Each query returns the manifestation breakdown corresponding to that cause’s row.

---


To recreate **Tables 4 and 5**, query all entries in the second dataset:

Select dataset:  
> 2. Rust vs CHERI Dataset  

Values in 'OS':  
> 1. Linux
